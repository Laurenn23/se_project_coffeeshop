# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

While this is only my second project in the course, playing with animations and other effects was a fun task.

1. **Enhanced Styling** Adding more animations and hover effects to gain more experience utilizing these special effects.
